  "demonstration": "\n\n## Example 1:\n\n## Instruction: Write a short story related to technological advancement.\n\n## Output: Elara traced the faint glyphs etched onto the smooth, obsidian surface of the Chronarium.  It hummed softly, a low thrum that vibrated through her fingertips.  She wasn't a chronomancer, not officially.  She was a data analyst for Chronotech, the corporation that had mastered the impossible \u2013 the manipulation of time itself, on a microscopic scale.\n\nThe Chronarium, a marvel of nano-engineering, allowed them to subtly alter the past. Not to rewrite history on a grand scale, but to correct minor anomalies, prevent accidents, or even\u2026 improve lives.  Today's task was the latter.\n\nThe glyphs depicted a young boy, his face blurred, an accident etched into the temporal fabric surrounding him. Elias Thorne, twelve years old, a budding musician, about to be struck by a carelessly driven car. Chronotech had access to his timeline, a fragile strand woven into the vast tapestry of time.  Elara's job was to subtly nudge the car's trajectory, a feather-light touch on the timeline, using the Chronarium.\n\nShe keyed in the precise coordinates, the nanosecond of impact, the calculated vector of the alteration.  A soft, blue light pulsed from the Chronarium.  A shiver ran down Elara's spine \u2013 it felt like watching a butterfly's wing shift the course of a hurricane.  \n\nThe boy's image in the Chronarium sharpened. His face, previously blurry with the impending tragedy, became clear.  He was smiling, fiddling with a battered violin case.  The accident never happened.\n\nElara leaned back, a wave of exhaustion washing over her. The burden of manipulating time, even on a small scale, was immense. The ethical considerations were never far from her mind.  The potential for misuse, for creating paradoxes, hung heavy in the air.\n\nThat evening, Elara heard a news report. A local orchestra was holding auditions.  A young virtuoso, barely a teenager, was set to perform.  His name: Elias Thorne.  His instrument: a violin.\n\nElara smiled.  The Chronarium hummed quietly in the adjacent room, a silent testament to the power, and the peril, of their technological advancement.  She knew the subtle shift she'd made was only a single thread in the vast tapestry of existence. But it was a thread that had saved a life, a life that would now compose its own beautiful melody in the symphony of time.\n\n## Example 2:\n\n## Instruction: Definition: Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.\nInput: Robert le Coq (died 1373) was a French bishop and councillor.\nOutput:\n\n## Output: What year did Robert le Coq die?\n\n## Example 3:\n\n## Instruction: if i am using Brave Browser's Sync functionality, how do the devices on the sync chain know it is me?\n\n## Output: Brave Sync uses a combination of techniques to verify that it's you accessing your synced data across devices:\n\n1. **Secret Key:** The core of Brave Sync's security is a secret encryption key generated on your *first* device when you enable Sync.  This key is *never* transmitted to Brave or any external server.  It's locally generated and then used to encrypt all your synced data before it's sent to any other device.\n\n2. **Device Verification:** When you add a new device to your Sync chain, it doesn't automatically get access. Instead, it needs to prove it possesses the same secret key.  This verification happens locally, without sending the key itself over the network.  Think of it like a cryptographic handshake\u2014a process where both devices prove they have the same secret without actually revealing it.\n\n3. **End-to-End Encryption:** All data synced between your devices is encrypted end-to-end using this secret key.  Even Brave servers (if they're involved in relaying data\u2014which they are not in the default configuration) cannot decrypt this data. They act only as message relays and have no knowledge of the content.\n\n**In short:**  The devices don't \"know\" it's you in a user-identifiable way. Instead, they use cryptographic techniques to prove they share the same secret key, demonstrating that they are authorized to access the synchronized data.  There's no username, password, or other personal information transmitted for authentication.  The secret key itself is the authentication factor.\n\nThis method is more secure than systems that rely on a central server to validate identity because there's no single point of compromise for a potential attacker.  If someone gains access to a Brave server (highly unlikely, given the design), they still can't decrypt your synced data.\n\n## Example 4:\n\n## Instruction: TASK DEFINITION: In this task, you are given a sentence in the French language. Your task is to convert it to Slovak language.\nPROBLEM: A conserver au r\u00e9frig\u00e9rateur Ne pas congeler A conserver dans l\u2019 emballage ext\u00e9rieur d'origine, \u00e0 l\u2019 abri de la lumi\u00e8re.\n\nSOLUTION: Uchov\u00e1vajte v chladni\u010dke Neuchov\u00e1vajte v mrazni\u010dke Uchov\u00e1vajte v p\u00f4vodnom obale na ochranu pred svetlom\n\nPROBLEM: 14 MENTIONS DEVANT FIGURER SUR L\u2019EMBALLAGE EXTERIEUR\n\nSOLUTION: 14 \u00daDAJE, KTOR\u00c9 MAJ\u00da BY\u0164 UVEDEN\u00c9 NA VONKAJ\u0160OM OBALE\n\nPROBLEM: 47 A.\n\nSOLUTION:\n\n## Output: 47 A.
